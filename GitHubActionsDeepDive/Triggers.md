## GitHub Actions Workflow Triggers

GitHub Actions workflows can be triggered by different events. Below is a collection of the most commonly used triggers and some interesting combinations.

### 1. **Push and Pull Request Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
```
- Runs the workflow on `push` and `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.

### 2. **Schedule Trigger (Cron Jobs)**
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1"
```
- Runs the workflow every Monday at midnight UTC.

### 3. **Manual Trigger (Workflow Dispatch)**
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
```
- Allows manual triggering with an input parameter.
#### `workflow_dispatch` is a manual trigger for GitHub Actions workflows. It allows users to start a workflow directly from the GitHub UI or via the GitHub API.

### Providing Input to `workflow_dispatch`
You can define inputs for `workflow_dispatch`, which allows users to provide values when triggering the workflow.

#### Example:
    ```yaml
    on:
    workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
        environment:
            description: "Environment to deploy to"
            required: true
            default: "staging"
            type: choice
            options:
            - staging
            - production
        debug:
            description: "Enable debug mode"
            required: false
            default: "false"
            type: boolean
    ```

#### Triggering via GitHub UI
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Select the workflow that has `workflow_dispatch`.
3. Click **Run workflow** and provide the necessary inputs.

#### Triggering via GitHub CLI
    ```sh
    gh workflow run <workflow_name> --ref main --field environment=production --field debug=true
    ```

#### Triggering via GitHub API
    ```sh
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
        -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
        https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/WORKFLOW_FILE.yml/dispatches \
        -d '{"ref":"main","inputs":{"environment":"production","debug":"true"}}'
```

### 4. **Tag and Release Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  release:
    types: [created]
```
- Runs the workflow when a new tag starting with `v` is pushed or a release is created.


<br><br><br>


### 5. **Issue and PR Events**
```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed]
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]
```
- Runs when an issue is opened or closed, or when a PR receives or loses a label.

### 6. **Repository Dispatch for External Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [custom-event]
```
- Allows triggering workflows from external applications or repositories.

#### **How to Trigger the Custom Event**
To manually trigger this workflow, send a POST request to GitHubâ€™s API using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
     -H "Authorization: token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/dispatches \
     -d '{"event_type": "custom-event-name", "client_payload": {"key": "value"}}'
```
- Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your repository details.
- `"custom-event-name"` must match the event type defined in the workflow.
- `client_payload` allows sending extra data that the workflow can use.

#### **Accessing the Payload in the Workflow**
Inside the workflow, you can access the payload using `${{ github.event.client_payload.key }}`.
Example:
```yaml
jobs:
  custom-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Read Payload
        run: echo "Received: ${{ github.event.client_payload.key }}"
```

### **Use Cases for Custom Events**
- **Triggering workflows from external CI/CD pipelines.**
- **Starting workflows from another GitHub Action.**
- **Automating deployment steps triggered by external services.**

### 7. **Workflow Run Completion**
```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build and Test"]
    types:
      - completed
```
- Runs when the "Build and Test" workflow completes.


<br><br><br>


### 8. **Multiple Event Combinations**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 12 * * 5"
  workflow_dispatch:
```
- Triggers on push to `main` or `develop`, PR updates, every Friday at noon, or manually.

### 9. **Check Run and Status Events**
```yaml
on:
  check_run:
    types: [created, completed]
  status:
```
- Runs when a check run is created or completed, or a commit status changes.

### 10. **Auto-Trigger on PR Review**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]
```
- Runs when a review is submitted on a pull request.
