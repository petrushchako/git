# Setting Up a Custom GitHub Actions Runner

### About this lab
You are setting up a new app’s CI/CD process. Due to compliance requirements, this team’s code needs to run on your organization’s infrastructure, not GitHub’s. You will be provided with an EC2 instance, which you will need to set up to work as a GitHub runner. You will then need to set up a workflow to run only on that runner. Finally, you will need to disconnect the runner from your repo for the end of the lab.

### Learning objectives
- Set Up the Lab VM to Work as a Runner Connected to Your GitHub Repo
- Set Up a Workflow to Run on the Runner
- Remove the Runner from Your Repo

## Solution

## Set Up the Lab VM to Work as a Runner Connected to Your GitHub Repo
### Create a GitHub Repository and Add a Runner
1. After logging in to your GitHub account, select the Repositories tab, then click New.
2. In the Repository name field, enter an easily identifiable name for the repository (like needs-custom-runner).
3. Select Private to ensure only authorized users can create pull requests for your custom runner.
4. Click Create repository.
5. After the repository is created, select Settings in the top menu bar.
6. In the sidebar menu, select Actions, then select Runners.
7. Click New self-hosted Runner. GitHub provides you a list of commands to download, configure, and run the runner on a VM.
8. If you're using the VM provided for the lab, select the Linux option for the Operating System.
