### ABOUT THIS LAB
Your company has developed a mobile application. The GitHub README has developer notes, but users report they are not helpful for troubleshooting common user issues. Marketing has worked with the Engineering team to create a user guide Markdown document. This will be updated with every release. You need to develop a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy this user guide to GitHub Pages so users can access the latest user guide with each release.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
- Set Up Documentation to Deploy as Part of the Workflow
- Set Up a Trigger Condition for the Workflow
